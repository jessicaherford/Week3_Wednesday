// More Function Exercises!

// 1. Write a function that prints out the entire "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" song lyrics.
console.log('Question 1');
// 2. Use a function to ask a user for a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit.

// 3. Adding to the code in #3, prompt the user a second time to determine whether they'd like to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius
//    or from Celsius to Fahrenheit. To keep it simple, instruct them to use "F to C" or "C to F".
//    Alert them with an error if they do not follow the rules.

// 4. Create a 'Guessing Game'. The game starts by picking a random number.
//    It then prompts the user to guess the number. If the user's number is lower/higher,
//    it will prompt the user to enter another guess and tell the user if the guess was
//    too high or too low. This continues until the correct guess is entered.
//    When the correct guess is entered the user is given a success message with the correct number.

// 5. Without using Math.min(), write a function called minimum() that takes two numbers
//    and outputs the smallest one to the console.

// 6. Create a new function called minimum3() to find the smallest of three numbers


// 7. Write a function countBs() that takes a string as its only argument and returns
//    a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.
//    HINT: Google charAt()


// 8. Write a function called countChars() that behaves like countBs(), except it takes a
//    second argument that indicates what character is to be counted.
